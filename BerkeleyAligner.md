Welcome to the BerkeleyAligner code repository.  The version in the repository is 1.1, which fixes some issues with searching for posterior thresholds, and also changes the output format to match Moses.

Note that the latest version is 2.0.  Both source and pre-compiled versions are available from the Downloads tab.  The source code for version 2.0 is currently **not** in the repository.
